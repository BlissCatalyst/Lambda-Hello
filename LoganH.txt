HELLO WORLD! My name is Logan Hufstetler. 

    The three words I would describe me are as follows: Shy, Outgoing, and Curious.

    I love building computers for a purpose. I like to play video games which means that I need a computer that is powerful enough to run games. 
    I don't have anything majorly impressive, but it gets the job done! I recently upgraded the case for better airflow. I found one that offered that,
    and it offers great views from its tempered glass side panels. I have named it; The Penthouse. You always have to name a new build. That's the rule. 
    I don't think I could ever use a Mac...
